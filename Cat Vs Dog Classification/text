ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using Deep Learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras to perform binary classification.

ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
Rescaling: Normalize pixel values (0-255 â†’ 0-1)
Resizing: Convert all images to 224x224 pixels
Train-Validation Split: 80 training and 20 testing

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
We designed a CNN model with the following layers:
Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
Flatten layer to convert features into a 1D array
Fully connected Dense layer (128 neurons)
Dropout layer to prevent overfitting
Sigmoid activation for binary classification

ðŸŽ¯ Model Training & Evaluation
The model is trained for 10 epochs using a batch size of 32

ðŸ“Š Results & Accuracy
The model achieves around 80-90 accuracy on validation dataset.
The CNN successfully classifies cats and dogs in unseen images.
